# WokGen Business — Brand Kit Workflow

This workflow creates a complete visual brand identity from a single concept.

## What Brand Kit Generates

The Brand Kit tool produces 4 coordinated visuals:
1. **Primary Logo** — main wordmark or icon mark (landscape)
2. **Dark Background Logo** — reversed version for dark contexts
3. **Square Icon** — social media profile picture, app icon
4. **Wide Banner** — social media header / hero image

## Studio Setup

1. Go to [wokgen.wokspec.org/business/studio](https://wokgen.wokspec.org/business/studio)
2. Select tool: **Brand Kit**
3. Choose your industry category
4. Select visual style
5. Select brand mood

## Example Brand Concepts

### Tech SaaS Startup

Mood: Innovative
Industry: Technology
```

### Wellness Brand

### Craft Coffee Shop
```

Style: Organic
Mood: Friendly
Industry: Food & Beverage
```

## Workflow

1. Generate initial brand kit with your concept
2. Review all 4 outputs as a set — look for visual coherence
3. If one piece is off, regenerate that specific piece with a refined prompt
4. Download all 4 as PNGs
5. Build your brand guide from the generated color palette

## Tips

- The more specific your concept, the more cohesive the kit
- Include color direction in your prompt ("warm earth tones", "navy and gold")
- Style and mood fields do most of the heavy lifting — your prompt refines the concept
- For logo marks, "icon mark" style works better than wordmarks in this engine
